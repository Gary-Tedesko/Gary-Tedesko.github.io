            Covid has changed the normal way of life in every way possible, it doesn't feel that long ago when people were allowed to be out as long as they want, or even go out to a concert without worrying about catching the virus we all to this day: COVID-19. Our lives have changed whether that is from having to socially distance, not see family members who have risks, constantly wear masks to help stop the spread, stop going out in public in generally, and for 90% of students; their college expirence has changed. All of those reasons are tearing people around the world apart. It is a completely different way of life than what people are used to and hard to get used to. For families that are faced with finacial problems, there is no were to began, raising a child in this time can even be descirbed, it is heartbreaking. </p>

            COVID-19 isn't only affecting social life, it's effecting our economic stand point:</p>
        <ul class="mr-4 ml-4">
            <li>Small business (43%) have closed down due to Covid.</li>
            <li>Bankruptcies have been common this year.</li>
            <li>No bussinesses have opened up due to the regulations that have been in place.</li>
            <li>More than normal, people dont have money from the lack of jobs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="d-block text-light bg-primary ml-4 mr-4 p-4">
            From what is stated above, you can tell that Covid has hit the economy hard for the average person, or people who need jobs to pay rent and support their family. The only people thriving in a time like this are the big coorporations and individuals like Bezo and Mark Z, etc..</p>

            When talking about the political implications, COVID has brought a lot. This past election has been one of the craziest years we have ever seen. Due to the orders with social distancing and staying at home, the polls were claimed to be rigged causing a huge mess. Not only that but politicans get caught breaking the rules that they said was best to protect the community..  </p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p class="mb-0">"Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death."

            All in all, COVID-19 is something that should be taken serious and be delt with the right way, but I dont think it is something that should people in a state of mind that leaves them with fear. If everyone stood up and did what they had to do to be responsible, it wouldn't be look at the same way it was months ago. We could have sloved this problem long ago but people want to do things their own way. Whether that is citizens or higher ups, we all need to rise together and defeat this. Even though it has changed, there is more that has to be done. We can not move foward in a society that lives in fear and scared to live life. Something must be done, that being said it starts with the higher ups not lying to the everyday people by trying to gain revenue off something so horrible like he virus. </p>
