        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader, especially a QB</li>
        <li>Big footprint - impact on millions of football fans and change the world</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - laying his body on the line for the city of Denver, along with building with an organization that was nothing </li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When John Elway played the game of football, he single handly changed the game.
        The way he change the quarterback postion buy his althetic ability with the speed and power he brought to the run game, 
        or the way he threw the football 60 yeards with ease. Maybe with his skills is the reason Denver won 2 back to back superbowls.
        His ability to play the sport is the reason why John Elway is such a role model for so many real football fans.
